## Pairwise distances
Pairwise distances were calculated between species and groups (outgroups and blue, brown, green, orange, red and violet clades) using MEGA 11.0.8, with default parameters, and the provided alignment **Lventricosus.fas**. Please, note that the alignment should not be analyzed as protein-coding sequences. It also contains two ribosomal genes.
Because this is pretty straightforward analysis, only the R script used to draw the barplot is provided.
