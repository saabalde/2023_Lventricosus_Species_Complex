## Pairwise distances
Pairwise distances were calculated between species and groups (outgroups and blue, brown, green, orange, red and violet clades) using MEGA 11.0.8, with default parameters, and the provided alignment **Lventricosus.fas**. Please, note that the alignment should not be analyzed as protein-coding sequences. It also contains two ribosomal genes.
Because this is pretty straightforward analysis, only the R script used to draw the barplot is provided.

You should note the depicted distances do not represent all vs all distances. Because the outgroup taxa are pairs of *valid*, accepted species, the "Outgroups" category only includes the distances between sister species. In contrast, because we are testing the validity of each clade a distinct species, the average distance between clades are shown (e.g. the blue bars retpresent the average distances between the blue specimens vs brown, green, orange, red, and violet).
