# Hidden species diversity within the Mediterranean cone snail, *Lautoconus ventricosus*
## What was this study about?
I am not sure if this is entirely true, but I have heard several times the Mediterranean cone snail, *L. ventricosus*, is one of the mollusk species with more synonym names. Regardless if that little fact is true or not, a quick look to the [WoRMS database](https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=428401) is enough to find out that almost 100 names have been proposed for this species.

In this study, we have used *cox1* barcodes, complete mitochondrial genomes and low coverage nuclear genomes to delve into the diversity of cone snails in the Mediterranean Sea. We propose that *L. ventricosus* is actually a complex of cryptic species, with up to three different species hiding within the same name. Some support for a forth species is found in the data, but the signal is not strong enoughand more specimens should be included before making a decision.

## Repository description
This repository was originally created to share the R scripts used to draw the main figures of this manuscript. Its intended use, however, has been expanded to provide further details to replicate the main analyses of the study. Because of the size of the files, only a handful of the input data will be provided, while all other will only be described.
