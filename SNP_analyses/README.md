## Brief introduction
The recently published [high-quality genome of *L. ventricosus*](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab037) was used as reference to map the raw sequencing data from all specimens, variant calling was performed with [freebayes](https://github.com/freebayes/freebayes), and filtered with [VCFtools](https://vcftools.github.io/index.html) and [vcffilter](https://github.com/biopet/vcffilter).

Unfortunately, the input and intermediate files are too big to be shared here. Hence, I will just describe the steps necessary to replicate these analyses and share the R script used to plot the PCA.

The reference genome can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=conus+ventricosus). Links to raw reads were provided in [the main site](../README.md).

## Variant calling

## SNP analysis: PCA

## SNP analysis: Phylogenetics

## Can we see a pattern in the PCA?
